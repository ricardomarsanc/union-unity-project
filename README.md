# Milo and the Lost Island 

This is a very early prototype of a 3D puzzle/platforming game. This game tells the story of Milo, a sailor who travels the world looking for new adventures. His boat sinks during a storm and he wakes up in a lonely beach. His purpose is to interact with the people who lives in that island and the near ones in order to get the necessary materials to fix his boat. All quests are normally puzzles in which Milo has to find a lost artifact using the hints the people can give to him.

The game is in early development, initially created for a Game Jam, but now we have planned to extend the prototype at least until we have a solid MVP. Probably this repo is going to be discontinued because we have planned to migrate the game to Unreal Engine.
